// A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
let myVar = newVar;

// How do we change the value of a variable?
// Reassign it to a different value

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
exisitingVar = newVar

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// Writing out your thought process in simple words before you code.

// B. Strings
// For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via 
// the following instructions.

// Create a variable called firstVariable
// Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
let firstVariable = "Hello World"

// Change the value of this variable to some number
firstVariable = 5;

// Store the value of firstVariable in a new variable called secondVariable
secondVariable = firstVariable;

// Change the value of secondVariable to any string.
secondVariable = "Good Morning"

// What is the value of firstVariable?
5

// Create a variable called yourName and set it equal to your name as a string.
let yourName = "Steven"

// Then, write an expression that takes the string “Hello, my name is ”
// and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
"Hello my name is " + yourName;

// C. Booleans
// Using the provided variable definitions, replace the blanks so that all log statements 
// print truein the console. Answers should be all be valid JS syntax and 
// not weird things that don’t make sense but happen to print trueto the console
const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

  console.log(a < b);
  console.log(c > d);
  console.log('Name' == 'Name');
  console.log(false == false)
  console.log(e === 'Kevin');
  console.log(a + b == c); // note: a < b < c is NOT CORRECT (and is not a valid JS expression, think about using other math operations)
  console.log(a * a == d); // note: the answer is a simple arithmetic equation, not something "weird"
  console.log(48 = '48');
